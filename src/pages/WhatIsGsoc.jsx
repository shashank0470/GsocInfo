          Google Summer of Code (GSoC) is a global program by Google that gives students and open-source beginners the opportunity to contribute to real-world projects during the summer. You work with open-source organizations, write code, get mentored, and earn a stipend — usually $750, $1,500, or $3,000 for small, medium, and large projects.

          GSoC is not a traditional internship. Instead of working for Google directly, you contribute to a project under a selected open-source organization, with the help of experienced mentors who guide and review your work. It’s a way to learn by doing — with real-world code, meaningful impact, and global community collaboration.

        <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold text-[var(--primary)] mt-6">Key Features</h3>
        <br />
        <ul className="list-disc pl-6 space-y-2 text-[var(--text-dim)]">
          <li>Organizations: These are open-source projects (like Mozilla, Python, Wikimedia, etc.) that apply to participate in GSoC. If accepted, they provide mentors and project ideas for contributors.</li>
          <li>Contributors: You — the student or beginner — choose a project from an accepted organization, write a proposal explaining how you’ll complete it, and if selected, you work on it during the summer.</li>
          <li>Mentors: Every contributor is assigned one or more mentors from the organization who help with guidance, reviews, and feedback.</li>
          <li>Proposal: A detailed plan that you submit to explain what project you want to work on, how you plan to do it, and what timeline you’ll follow.</li>
          <li>Stipend: Google pays contributors in two parts — after mid-term and final evaluations — based on the completion and quality of your work. The amount varies depending on the size of the project and your country’s PPP (purchasing power parity).</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold text-[var(--primary)] mt-6"> Duration and Phases</h3>
        <br />
        <p className="list-disc pl-6 space-y-2 text-[var(--text-dim)]">
          <li>GSoC typically starts in February (announcement) and ends by September (final evaluations).</li>
          <li>The project has phases: application, bonding period, coding period (with midterm and final evaluations).</li>
          <li>You choose the project size (Small, Medium, or Large) based on how much time and work you can commit.</li>
        </p>


        <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold text-[var(--primary)] mt-6">What Makes GSoC Special?</h3>

          <li>Remote & flexible: You work from anywhere in the world, with your own schedule.</li>
          <li>Beginner-friendly: You don't need to be an expert — just passionate, consistent, and eager to learn.</li>
          <li>Build your resume: GSoC is highly respected in the tech world. It proves your ability to write production-level code, work in teams,and contribute to real-world problems.</li>
          <li>Open-source exposure: You become part of a global open-source ecosystem that stays with you even after the program ends.</li>
