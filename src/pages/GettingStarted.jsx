            Getting started with GSoC begins with understanding how open source works. Start by exploring past organizations on the <a href="https://www.gsocorganizations.dev/" className="bg-amber-600 rounded text-black">GSoC website</a> , and look for projects that match your interests â€” like frontend, backend, Python, machine learning, etc. Choosing the right organization is a crucial step, so take your time and pick the one that aligns best with your skills and interests. 
            You can also use filters to find the most frequently participating organizations. Begin contributing by finding bugs, fixing errors, improving documentation, or solving beginner-friendly issues.

          <p className="text-[var(--text-dim)] mt-2">
            If you're new to coding or tech communities, the term "open source" might sound a bit confusing at first. But donâ€™t worry â€” letâ€™s break it down in the simplest way possible..
          </p>

          <p className="text-[var(--text-dim)] mt-2">
            <h3 className="text-lime-400">~ What is Open Source?</h3>
          
            Open source software is software whose source code is publicly available for anyone to see, use, modify, and share.
            <br />
            Example:<p className="text-amber-600">Itâ€™s like a recipe thatâ€™s shared with the whole world â€” anyone can read it, improve it, or remix it and share it again.</p>
          
            Unlike proprietary software (like Microsoft Word or Photoshop), where only the company can make changes, open source is built and maintained by communities of developers around the world.
            
          </p>


          <p className="text-[var(--text-dim)] mt-2">
            <h3 className="text-lime-400">~ Who Works on Open Source Projects?</h3>
          
            Anyone â€” literally anyone!
            You donâ€™t need a degree, job title, or years of experience. People who contribute include:
            
            <li>Students</li>
            <li>Professionals</li>
            <li>Hobbyists</li>
            <li>First-time coders</li>
            <li>And people just like you</li>
            Contributions come in many forms â€” not just writing code.
          </p>

            <h3 className="text-lime-400">~ Ways You Can Contribute (Even as a Beginner)</h3>
          
            You don't need to build complex features to start. You can:
            
            <li>ðŸ›  Fix bugs or small errors</li>
            <li>ðŸ“„ Improve documentation (typos, grammar, clarity)</li>
            <li>ðŸŽ¨ Help with design or UI suggestions</li>
            <li>ðŸ§ª Test features and report issues</li>
            <li>ðŸ’¬ Answer community questions</li>
            <li>ðŸ§¹ Clean or organize project files</li>
            <li>ðŸ—‚ Translate content</li>
            Every small contribution matters. Open-source projects grow because people like you take the first step.

            <h3 className="text-lime-400">~ Why Open Source Matters</h3>            
            <li>It powers the internet: Linux, Git, VS Code, Python, Firefox â€” all are open source.</li>
            <li>It teaches real-world coding, teamwork, and problem-solving.</li>
            <li>Itâ€™s collaborative: you learn how to work with others using Git, GitHub, and issue trackers.</li>
            <li>It builds your portfolio: your work is public, visible, and impactful.</li>
            <li>It creates connections: you become part of global developer communities.</li>
          </p>

            <h3 className="text-lime-400">~ How It Connects to GSoC</h3>    
            Google Summer of Code is all about contributing to open-source projects. So before you dive into proposals or organizations, itâ€™s important to understand:        
            <li>What open source is,understand terms used and its workflow.</li>
            <li>How projects work, each project has different structure and work differently.</li>
            <li>How communities collaborate,talking and engaging with individuals who are already doing good in open source.</li>
            <li>What tools (like Git/GitHub) are used.</li>
            By learning open source, youâ€™re not just preparing for GSoC â€” youâ€™re stepping into a global movement of knowledge sharing, collaboration, and real-world learning.
